INSANITYHOST SLA - Last Updated: 4th February 2021


InsanityHost endeavours to provide all services with 100% uptime. If this is not met, the client may be eligible for compensation in the form of account credit.

Downtime is classified as a period of time in a calendar month where a client is unable to access/utilize the service they have purchased from InsanityHost. However, InsanityHost is not responsible for any downtime caused by a third-party such as software/hardware failure.

The client becomes eligible to claim compensation once a service has been unavailable for a period of time that exceeds 15 consecutive minutes. For every 30 minutes of consecutive downtime, once the initial 15-minute timeframe has passed, the client is eligible to claim 1% of the total monthly cost of the affected services' up to a total of 100% of the affected services' monthly cost. 

Excluded from this are downtimes caused by:
1. External issues, such as datacenter issues.
2. Illegal activities against the client or by the client, such as DDOS attacks.
3. Any client-side issues such as problems connecting to the internet.
4. Exceeding the resources purchased by the client.
5. Any planned maintenance by either InsanityHost or a third-party.
6. Any emergency maintenance by either InsanityHost or a third-party where little to no notice was given.

Furthermore, InsanityHost reserves the right to reject SLA claims demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt to be fraudulent.
